# Get to Work app

I love to make to-do lists on paper, but sometimes those lists get lost! Having paper to-do lists is also pretty wasteful. I developed this app to make creating to do lists easy, fun, and without wasting paper.

## How it works

A user is able to add tasks via the input box at the top of the screen. The added tasks will be added to the list below the input box. Those tasks are also added to a SQL database. As the user finishes their work, they can mark the tasks as complete, which changes the style of the task and moves it to the bottom of the list. The user is also able to delete tasks, whether those tasks have been completed or not. The user will be asked to verify that they wanted to delete the task before it is removed from the list and the database.

## Future Updates

In the future, the alert box could be changed into a modal, which would be more appealing visually. It would also be useful to be able to toggle whether a task is completed or not, especially for recurring tasks.
